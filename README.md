# FunnyCoffee

yes.
basically batchest v2 cuz most codes are recycled from [BatChest](https://github.com/HugeBrain16/BatChest) but this one uses different API

## How to run

install stuff from `requirements.txt` first then run the `bot.py` file.
  
this is optional but, if you don't want to get enter token prompts  
you can create `.env` file and put ur token there in specific keys  
for example in `.env`:

```ini
TOKEN=asdasdasidjoiajsdoij23-0iasidjoiajsd
```
